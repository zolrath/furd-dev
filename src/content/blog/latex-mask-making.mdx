## Why not
I used to go all out for Halloween, making custom props and costumes, but I haven't done much in the last few years.
Let's learn to make our own latex mask.

## Sculpture
First we'll sculpt a mask
## Mold
Then we'll mold it
## Latex
Then we'll pour latex into our mold
## Paint
Then we'll airbrush it
## Hair
Then we'll punch hair into it.
