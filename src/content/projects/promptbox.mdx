If you've played the game [Eat Poop You Cat](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30618/eat-poop-you-cat) or its more commercially acceptable [Telestrations](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46213/telestrations) you know how fun it is to play a game of artistic telephone.

## Basic Rules
Players go back and forth between drawing a prompt and guessing what the previous player drew. The game ends when the prompt reaches the last player.

## Whats changed?
Promptbox is a game that takes that concept and adds a little AI to help players who have anxiety about not being able to draw play the game.
In the end, the prompt and the players drawing are combined to create 3 images for the player to choose from.
The next player sees the selected image and round and round it goes!

At the end of the game the whole chain is replayed, showing the prompt, the players drawing, and the AI assisted image.
