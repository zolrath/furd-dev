Wemux story roughly: Want to help a friend learn programming through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) but have no easy way for us to show each other what we're working on. Tmux has awkward method of doing it - create wemux to make it easy.

```bash title="fish"
ls
```

```ps frame="code" title="PowerShell Profile.ps1" {1, 4-5}
# Without overriding, this would be a terminal frame
function Watch-Tail { Get-Content -Tail 20 -Wait $args }
New-Alias tail Watch-Tail
these are more lines
they're cool okay
more lines
yes
```
