## Hello
Hi, I'm Matt Furden.
I'm a software engineer and artist who loves to build things and learn along the way.

I also find myself teaching others a lot, so I thought I'd start writing down some of my thoughts and experiences here.

## What I do
I've had a 16 year career in software development and every day is still a new experience as I can't seem to stop trying to work on new types of projects and languages.


Depending on the post we might find ourselves talking about C#, Elixir, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Odin, or GDScript.

### What I'm doing

I've been working on a game development project called [Uprooted](/projects/uprooted) lately, so you'll probably see a lot of posts about [Godot](https://godotengine.org).
