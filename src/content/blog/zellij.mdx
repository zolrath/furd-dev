## The problem with tmux
For over a decade I've used tmux on and off to manage terminal sessions and tabs. I even made [wemux](/projects/wemux) to make it easier to share a tmux session with a friend.

It's great - but it's not user friendly.
After a bunch of configuration and a bunch of time spent learning the key bindings it's great - but that's a lot to ask of someone who just wants to get started.

## Zellij to the rescue
[Zellij](https://zellij.dev) gives a incredibly friendly user interface by default, showing the hot keys at the bottom of the screen, making it easy to learn.
